# FI/RE Manager
A finace tracking tool I'm making to help with:
- Managing your portfolio
- checking your income & expenditure
- Setting budgets
- Financial calculators (compound interest, mortage, etc.)

Technologies used:
- Vue.js
- Nuxt
- Tailwindcss
- vuetify
- D3.js (Planned)
- Firebase (Planned)
- various API's (Planned)
Note: "Planned" means that while they are not being used yet, they will be used once I start implementing more features and functionality.
